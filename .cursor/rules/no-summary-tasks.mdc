# No Summary Tasks After Completion

- **NEVER** create summary tasks, follow-up todos, or "completed" todo lists after finishing work
- **NEVER** use `todo_write` to create summary or completion tracking tasks
- When work is complete, simply finish - do not create additional todo items to document what was done
- Only create todos when actively planning or breaking down work that needs to be done, not after it's finished
- Do not announce that you're "creating a summary" or "updating todos" after completing tasks

## Examples

**BAD** - Don't do this:
- Creating a summary todo after completing a feature
- Marking todos as complete and then creating new summary todos
- Creating "documentation" or "follow-up" todos after finishing work

**GOOD** - Just finish:
- Complete the task
- Provide a brief response if needed
- Move on - no todo creation needed
